DESCRIPTION_xtrans-src: The X Transport Interface is intended to combine all system and transport specific code into a single place.  This API should be used by all libraries, clients and servers of the X Window System. Use of this API should allow the addition of new types of transports and support for new platforms without making any changes to the source except in the X Transport Interface code.  This package contains sources for debugging purposes.
