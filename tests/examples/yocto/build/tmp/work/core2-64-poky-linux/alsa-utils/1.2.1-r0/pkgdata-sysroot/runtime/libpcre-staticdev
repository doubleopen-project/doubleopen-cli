DESCRIPTION_libpcre-staticdev: The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. PCRE has its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API.  This package contains static libraries for software development.
